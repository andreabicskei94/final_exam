My final exam project as a Software Developer, developed in C++, QT Creator was used in order to implement GUI of the project. It's a small food ordering system, using SQL database.
After running the program the user have two options to get into, 
1. as a user
2. as an admin 


As an admin you can change the whole menu, you can see all the users, with their amount of bill and type of food what they ordered.
After you registered as a user you have to choose between the food and add them to your cart. By the next step, you have to fill up the needed informations: adress, phone nr etc.
By a successful order as an admin, you can see the new order if you log in.

Contact me to get the pw for admin.
